# 🔧 Zalo Environment Debug

## 🚨 Current Issue:
Despite multiple fixes, callback URL still returns `localhost:5000` instead of `toolbox.vn`

## ✅ Fixes Applied:
1. **Main Route Fixed**: `server/routes/zalo-auth.ts` → Force production URL
2. **Environment Utils Fixed**: `server/utils/environment.ts` → Always return `toolbox.vn`
3. **Backup Files Removed**: Moved conflicting routes to `.backup` files
4. **OAuth Routes Fixed**: Updated all `zalo-oauth.ts`, `zalo-auth-working.ts` files

## 🔍 Debugging Steps:

### 1. Check Route Response:
```bash
curl -s "https://toolbox.vn/api/auth/zalo" 2>&1 | head -5
```

### 2. Expected vs Actual:
**Expected:**
```
redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftoolbox.vn%2Fzalo-callback
```

**Actual (Still Wrong):**
```  
redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5000%2Fzalo-callback
```

## 🎯 Potential Root Causes:

1. **Route Caching**: Server might be caching old route responses
2. **Multiple Route Handlers**: Could have route conflicts still active
3. **Environment Variable Override**: Some env var might be forcing localhost
4. **Production vs Development**: Environment detection logic might be wrong

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Restart application completely
2. Test immediately after restart
3. Check logs for environment detection
4. Verify no route conflicts exist
5. Manually test production URL generation

**Goal: Get `https://toolbox.vn/zalo-callback` as redirect_uri**
