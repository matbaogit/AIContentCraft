# 🎯 Zalo Production Final Fix

## 📊 Current Status:
- ✅ Express route added to server/routes.ts  
- ✅ File exists on toolbox.vn (HTTP 200)
- ❌ Apache serves static file before Node.js route
- ❌ Still getting 404 in browser

## 🔍 Root Cause Discovered:
**Apache Static File Priority**: toolbox.vn's Apache server serves static files before passing requests to Node.js application.

```
Request Flow:
toolbox.vn/zalo-callback-redirect.html → Apache serves static file → ❌ Old content
```

## ✅ Solution Required:

### Option 1: Update Static File (Immediate)
Replace the existing `zalo-callback-redirect.html` on toolbox.vn with updated content from `zalo-callback-redirect-updated.html`.

### Option 2: Alternative Route (Backup)
Use different callback URL that doesn't conflict with static files:
```
https://toolbox.vn/api/zalo-callback-redirect
```

## 📋 Current Working Flow in Development:
```
1. User clicks Zalo → Development OAuth URL
2. OAuth callback → Zalo processes in development ✅  
3. Token exchange successful ✅
4. User info blocked by IP restriction (expected) ✅
5. Confirmation modal opens ✅
```

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Update static file on toolbox.vn OR
2. Change callback URL in Zalo Developer Console to avoid static file conflict

## 📄 File to Upload:
Content in `zalo-callback-redirect-updated.html` contains the complete redirect logic needed for production OAuth flow.
